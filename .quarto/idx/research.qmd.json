First introduced by President Reagan in 1984, the policy has been rescinded by every Democratic administration and reinstated by every Republican. We examine the effects of the GGR on maternal mortality across two presidential transitions: Clinton to Bush (1993–2008) and Obama to Trump (2009–2020). Our empirical strategy employs a triple difference design that leverages cross-country variation in U.S. aid dependence and within-country variation in baseline clinic access to measure exposure. We find that, on average, the reinstatement of the GGR is associated with a 16.7 percent increase in maternal mortality in highly-exposed aid-receiving countries. We also uncover larger effects under the Trump administration, likely due to the policy's unprecedented expansion in 2017.\n</details>\n\n- **Occupation Flexibility and the Graduate Gender Wage Gap in the UK** (with Liza Benny, Sonia Bhalotra, Manuel Fernández, and Fan Wang) <i><small>-- Draft available soon!</small></i>\n<details>\n  <summary>Abstract</summary>\n     We study how gender differences in the demand and supply of job flexibility contribute to the gender wage gap over the life cycle and over time for graduates in the UK. We are estimating a model of labor supply and demand to quantify the role of changing preferences and relative demand for flexibility. Our current findings suggest that higher relative demand for male labour at older ages and in less flexible occupations, together with women’s higher preferences for flexible work in recent cohorts, jointly explain a substantial share of the observed widening of the gender wage gap.\n</details>\n\n- **Dating Preferences** (with Sonia Bhalotra, George Beknazar-Yuzbashev, Damian Clarke, and Mateusz Stalinski) <i><small>-- Pre-analysis plan drafted</small></i>\n<details>\n  <summary>Abstract</summary>\n    We investigate how individuals trade off personality traits and ideology against attributes such as attractiveness and income when searching for potential partners. We are creating a dating site that includes AI-generated profiles together with actual participants, an approach that will allow us to elicit nuanced preferences in a controlled yet realistic setting.\n</details>\n\n- **Immigration and Assimilation of the Chinese Diaspora in Indonesia** <i><small>-- Analysis in progress</small></i>\n<details>\n  <summary>Abstract</summary>\n     This paper examines the role of state policy in fostering immigrant integration in the context of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Ethnic Chinese faced institutionalized discrimination during the New Order regime (1966–1998), which was revoked following the fall of Suharto. I exploit cross-regional variation in pre-revocation ethnic Chinese population shares as a proxy for out-group exposure. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the revocation of discriminatory legislation fostered cultural assimilation, yet created a backlash in political integration. Additional data collection is progress to investigate mechanisms behind the divergence between cultural and political assimilation.\n</details>\n\n# Resting Papers\n- **Economic Dependence and Political Dispute Across the Taiwan Strait** (with Chiman Cheung and Tzu-Ting Yang) \n<details>\n  <summary>Abstract</summary>\n    Does economic integration foster political affinity, or can it trigger a backlash? We approach this question by investigating an unconventional type of “China shock” in the context of the Taiwanese export surge to mainland China. Applying a shift-share design with newly delineated commuting zones (CZs) in Taiwan, our preliminary findings suggest that an across-CZ interquartile change in China export exposure leads to a 1.2\\% increase in pro-independence vote shares during 2000-2016. Individual data from socioeconomic surveys reveals similar effects on pro-independence attitudes. We do not, however, find evidence of export exposure affecting inclination toward a more exclusive Taiwanese versus Chinese identity. To understand the mechanisms behind the political backlash of trade integration, we plan to disentangle the potential roles of labor market adjustments to trade versus a direct political deterrence effect from overall economic dependence.\n</details>","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{.column-screen}\n![](static/img/lapalma.jpg)\n<div class=\"overlay-text\">\n# Research\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: right; margin-top: 4px;\">\nLa Palma, Spain\n</div>\n:::\n\n<br />\n\n# Working Papers\n\n**(Job Market Paper) Corruption and Talent Allocation** <i><small>-- Under review</small></i>\n\n<small>**[[Latest Version](https://yangxun.org/Research/JMP_Xun_2025.pdf)]** (Sept 2025); **[[WRAP WP](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/188397/)]** (Oct 2024)</small>\n\n\n<details open>\n  <summary>Abstract</summary>\n    Leveraging an anti-corruption audit program in Brazil, I investigate whether corruption shifts the allocation of talent.
