Welcome! I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Economics, University of [Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/). I obtained my PhD in Economics from [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/index.asp) in 2024. I will be on the 2025-2026 econ job market.

I work in the area of applied microeconomics. My fields of research are **development economics** and **political economy**. I am also interested in policy evaluation in the areas of **health** and **labour economics**.

You can find my [CV](https://yangxun96.github.io/cv/CV_YangXun.pdf) and [research statement](https://yangxun.org/Research/research_statement.pdf) here.
