**Corruption and Talent Allocation** - *Draft Available Soon!*

*Abstract*:  Does political corruption drive talent allocation into the public sector? I answer this question by exploiting a randomized anti-corruption audit program in Brazil together with rich micro-data on prospective college students. Under a generalized difference-in-difference research design, I find that students exposed to audits are less likely to end up majoring in business administration and law, which is more tailored toward public sector careers. In the meantime, students are more likely to opt for a degree in engineering. Tracking students to the labor market demonstrates that audits also lead to a rise in private-sector employment yet have no overall impact on employment in the public sector. However, a closer investigation into workforce composition reveals that civil servants from audited municipalities tend to be of lower ability as measured by standardized test scores. I provide supportive evidence that the effects of audits on equilibrium talent allocation are driven by changes in talent supply rather than talent demand. Taken together, these findings highlight an under-studied negative consequence of corruption on the economy: the distortion of a societyâ€™s talent allocation towards the state sector.
