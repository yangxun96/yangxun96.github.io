** (Job Market Paper) Corruption and Talent Allocation** <i><small>Under Review</small></i>

<small>**[[Latest Version](https://yangxun.org/Research/JMP_Xun_2025.pdf)]** (Sept 2025); **[[WRAP WP](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/188397/)]** (Oct 2024)</small>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Leveraging an anti-corruption audit program in Brazil, I investigate whether corruption shifts the allocation of talent. I link administrative data on program rollout with education and employer-employee registers. Following audits, high-ability students change their college major to be less aligned with public sector careers, and they become less likely to enter public sector careers later on. Investigating mechanisms, I argue that these results are driven by the perception of lower returns to public sector careers owing to reduced rents and the risk of reputation loss. My findings highlight an understudied consequence of corruption, namely, the distortionary impacts on talent sorting.

# Selected Work in Progress
- **The Global Health Toll of the Global Gag Rule** (with Sonia Bhalotra and Damian Clarke) <i>Draft Coming Soon!</i>
<!-- <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
     The Global Gag Rule (GGR) is a pro-life policy that prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations receiving U.S. aid from providing or advocating for abortion-related services. First introduced by President Reagan in 1984, the policy has been reinstated by every Republican administration and rescinded by every Democrat. We examine the effects of the GGR on maternal mortality across two presidential transitions: Clinton to Bush (1993–2008) and Obama to Trump (2009–2020). Our empirical strategy employs a triple difference design that leverages cross-country variation in US aid dependence and within-country variation in baseline clinic access to measure exposure. We find that, on average, the reinstatement of the GGR is associated with a 16.7 percent increase in maternal mortality in aid-receiving countries. We also uncover larger effects under the Trump administration, likely due to the policy’s unprecedented expansion in 2017.

- **Immigration and Assimilation of the Chinese Diaspora in Indonesia**
<!-- <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
     This paper studies the effects of state-enforced assimilation policy on immigrant integration. I focus on the Chinese diaspora in Indonesia when long-lasting anti-Chinese legislation during the New Order (1966-1998) was revoked after the fall of Suharto. I exploit across-regency differences in ethnic Chinese shares prior to the revoke as a proxy for the intensity of out-group exposure. The difference-in-difference estimates suggest the revoke of the legislation fostered cultural assimilation of Chinese Indonesians, as measured by language use and religious affiliation. Additional data collection is in process to study economic and political assimilation, as ethnic Chinese are perceived as economic insiders but political outsiders in Indonesia. All in all, this study aims to contribute to understanding how state policy affects immigrant integration in the context of south-south migration.

# Resting Papers
- **Economic Dependence and Political Dispute Across the Taiwan Strait** (with Chiman Cheung and Tzu-Ting Yang) 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Does economic integration foster political affinity, or can it trigger a backlash? We approach this question by investigating an unconventional type of “China shock” in the context of the Taiwanese export surge to mainland China. Applying a shift-share design with newly delineated commuting zones (CZs) in Taiwan, our preliminary findings suggest that an across-CZ interquartile change in China export exposure leads to a 1.2\% increase in pro-independence vote shares during 2000-2016. Individual data from socioeconomic surveys reveals similar effects on pro-independence attitudes. We do not, however, find evidence of export exposure affecting inclination toward a more exclusive Taiwanese versus Chinese identity. To understand the mechanisms behind the political backlash of trade integration, we plan to disentangle the potential roles of labor market adjustments to trade versus a direct political deterrence effect from overall economic dependence.
