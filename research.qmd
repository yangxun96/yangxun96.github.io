**Corruption and Talent Allocation** <i><small>Submitted</small></i>

<small>**[[Latest Version](https://yangxun.org/Research/JMP_Xun_2025.pdf)]** (May 2025); **[[WRAP WP](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/188397/)]** (Oct 2024)</small>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Can corruption shift talent allocation across public and private sector careers? I address this question by leveraging a randomized anti-corruption audit program in Brazil, combined with comprehensive micro-data on educational and labor market outcomes of college students. In audited municipalities, high-ability students are less likely to choose majors tailored toward public sector careers and subsequently enter public sector employment. Evidence suggests the effects are driven by the perception of lower rent-seeking returns and higher reputation costs. Overall, the findings highlight an understudied consequence of corruption on the economy: the distortion of talent allocation toward rent-seeking in the public sector.

# Selected Work in Progress
- **The Global Health Toll of the Global Gag Rule** (with Sonia Bhalotra and Damian Clarke) 

- **Immigration and Assimilation of the Chinese Diaspora in Indonesia**
<!-- <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
     This paper studies the effects of state-enforced assimilation policy on immigrant integration. I focus on the Chinese diaspora in Indonesia when long-lasting anti-Chinese legislation during the New Order (1966-1998) was revoked after the fall of Suharto. I exploit across-regency differences in ethnic Chinese shares prior to the revoke as a proxy for the intensity of out-group exposure. The difference-in-difference estimates suggest the revoke of the legislation fostered cultural assimilation of Chinese Indonesians, as measured by language use and religious affiliation. Additional data collection is in process to study economic and political assimilation, as ethnic Chinese are perceived as economic insiders but political outsiders in Indonesia. All in all, this study aims to contribute to understanding how state policy affects immigrant integration in the context of south-south migration.

# Resting Papers
- **Economic Dependence and Political Dispute Across the Taiwan Strait** (with Chiman Cheung and Tzu-Ting Yang) 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Does economic integration foster political affinity, or can it trigger a backlash? We approach this question by investigating an unconventional type of “China shock” in the context of the Taiwanese export surge to mainland China. Applying a shift-share design with newly delineated commuting zones (CZs) in Taiwan, our preliminary findings suggest that an across-CZ interquartile change in China export exposure leads to a 1.2\% increase in pro-independence vote shares during 2000-2016. Individual data from socioeconomic surveys reveals similar effects on pro-independence attitudes. We do not, however, find evidence of export exposure affecting inclination toward a more exclusive Taiwanese versus Chinese identity. To understand the mechanisms behind the political backlash of trade integration, we plan to disentangle the potential roles of labor market adjustments to trade versus a direct political deterrence effect from overall economic dependence.
