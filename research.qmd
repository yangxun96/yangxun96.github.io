**Corruption and Talent Allocation** - *Draft Available Soon!*

<details open>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Does political corruption shift talent allocation across public and private sectors? I answer this question by exploiting a randomized anti-corruption audit program in Brazil together with rich micro-data on educational and labor market outcomes of college students. Under a generalized difference-in-difference research design, I find that students experiencing audits in their municipality are less likely to major in business administration and law, which is more tailored toward public sector careers. Tracking students to the labor market further demonstrates that audits lead to a lower share of high-ability students obtaining their first jobs as civil servants. I provide evidence that dampened perceptions of rent-seeking in public sector careers are behind the effects of audits on equilibrium talent allocation. Taken together, these findings highlight an understudied negative consequence of corruption on the economy: the distortion of a society's talent allocation towards the state sector.
