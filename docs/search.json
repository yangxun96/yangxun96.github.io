I link administrative data on program rollout with education and employer-employee registers. Following audits, high-ability students change their college major to be less aligned with public sector careers, and they become less likely to enter public sector careers later on. Investigating mechanisms, I argue that these results are driven by the perception of lower returns to public sector careers owing to reduced rents and the risk of reputation loss. My findings highlight an understudied consequence of corruption, namely, the distortionary impacts on talent sorting.\n\n\n\nSelected Work in Progress\n\nThe Global Health Toll of the Global Gag Rule (with Sonia Bhalotra and Damian Clarke) – Draft available soon!\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Global Gag Rule (GGR) is a pro-life policy that prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations receiving U.S. aid from providing or advocating for abortion-related services. First introduced by President Reagan in 1984, the policy has been rescinded by every Democratic administration and reinstated by every Republican. We examine the effects of the GGR on maternal mortality across two presidential transitions: Clinton to Bush (1993–2008) and Obama to Trump (2009–2020). Our empirical strategy employs a triple difference design that leverages cross-country variation in U.S. aid dependence and within-country variation in baseline clinic access to measure exposure. We find that, on average, the reinstatement of the GGR is associated with a 16.7 percent increase in maternal mortality in highly-exposed aid-receiving countries. We also uncover larger effects under the Trump administration, likely due to the policy’s unprecedented expansion in 2017.\n\nOccupation Flexibility and the Gender Wage Gap in the UK (with Liza Benny, Sonia Bhalotra, Manuel Fernández, and Fan Wang) – Draft available soon!\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study how gender differences in the demand and supply of job flexibility contribute to the gender wage gap over the life cycle and over time in the UK. We are estimating a model of labor supply and demand to quantify the role of changing preferences and relative demand for flexibility. Our current findings suggest that higher relative demand for male labour at older ages and in less flexible occupations, together with women’s higher preferences for flexible work in recent cohorts, jointly explain a substantial share of the observed widening of the gender wage gap.\n\nDating Preferences (with Sonia Bhalotra, George Beknazar-Yuzbashev, Damian Clarke, and Mateusz Stalinski) – Pre-analysis plan drafted\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe investigate how individuals trade off personality traits and ideology against attributes such as attractiveness and income when searching for potential partners. We are creating a dating site that includes AI-generated profiles together with actual participants, an approach that will allow us to elicit nuanced preferences in a controlled yet realistic setting.\n\nImmigration and Assimilation of the Chinese Diaspora in Indonesia – Analysis in progress\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the role of state policy in fostering immigrant integration in the context of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Ethnic Chinese faced institutionalized discrimination during the New Order regime (1966–1998), which was revoked following the fall of Suharto. I exploit cross-regional variation in pre-revocation ethnic Chinese population shares as a proxy for out-group exposure. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the revocation of discriminatory legislation fostered cultural assimilation, yet created a backlash in political integration. Additional data collection is progress to investigate mechanisms behind the divergence between cultural and political assimilation.\n\n\n\n\nResting Papers\n\nEconomic Dependence and Political Dispute Across the Taiwan Strait (with Chiman Cheung and Tzu-Ting Yang)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nDoes economic integration foster political affinity, or can it trigger a backlash? We approach this question by investigating an unconventional type of “China shock” in the context of the Taiwanese export surge to mainland China. Applying a shift-share design with newly delineated commuting zones (CZs) in Taiwan, our preliminary findings suggest that an across-CZ interquartile change in China export exposure leads to a 1.2% increase in pro-independence vote shares during 2000-2016. Individual data from socioeconomic surveys reveals similar effects on pro-independence attitudes. We do not, however, find evidence of export exposure affecting inclination toward a more exclusive Taiwanese versus Chinese identity. To understand the mechanisms behind the political backlash of trade integration, we plan to disentangle the potential roles of labor market adjustments to trade versus a direct political deterrence effect from overall economic dependence."

    "text": "Working Papers\nCorruption and Talent Allocation [PDF]\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nTalent is a key input in the delivery of public services, yet less is known about what affects the supply of talent for the public sector. This paper studies the role of political corruption in shifting talent allocation across public and private sector careers. I exploit a randomized anti-corruption audit program in Brazil together with comprehensive micro-data on educational and labor market outcomes of college students. Using a generalized difference-in-difference research design, I find that high-ability students in audited municipalities are less likely to choose majors tailored toward public sector careers, such as business administration and law. Moreover, tracking students to the labor market demonstrates that audits also lead to a lower share of high-ability students working as civil servants. Finally, I provide suggestive evidence that the effects of audits on talent allocation can be driven by the perception of lower rent-seeking returns and higher reputation costs. Taken together, these findings highlight an understudied negative consequence of corruption on the economy: the distortion of talent allocation toward rent-seeking in the public sector.\n\n\n\nSelected Work in Progress\n\nEconomic Dependence and Political Dispute Across the Taiwan Strait (with Chiman Cheung and Tzu-Ting Yang)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nDoes economic integration foster political affinity, or can it trigger a backlash?

I focus on the Chinese diaspora in Indonesia when long-lasting anti-Chinese legislation during the New Order (1966-1998) was revoked after the fall of Suharto. I exploit across-regency differences in ethnic Chinese shares prior to the revoke as a proxy for the intensity of out-group exposure. The difference-in-difference estimates suggest the revoke of the legislation fostered cultural assimilation of Chinese Indonesians, as measured by language use and religious affiliation. Additional data collection is in process to study economic and political assimilation, as ethnic Chinese are perceived as economic insiders but political outsiders in Indonesia. All in all, this study aims to contribute to understanding how state policy affects immigrant integration in the context of south-south migration.\n\nEngineering Education and Bureaucratic Supply：Evidence from India"
